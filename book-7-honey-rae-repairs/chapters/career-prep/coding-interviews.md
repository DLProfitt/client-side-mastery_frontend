# Coding/ Whiteboard Interviews

These are questions where the interviewer asks you to solve a particular problem either by talking it through, writing code, or writing or pseudo-code.

You might be given a take-home test where you have to build an app in a certain amount of time. The projects you build in class will already be pretty good prep for this sort of interview, so you don't need to worry about this one for now. 

You also you might be ask to think through a problem in the interview itself. We call these "white boarding interviews" although there is rarely an actual white board involved anymore. Usually you'll be presented with a small logic problem similar to the ones you worked on during the first weeks of NewForce. You'll want to think of these interviews as a collaboration with the interviewer. You're allowed to ask questions, discuss ideas, and get feedback just like you would on a team. Above all, make sure you understand the problem you're trying to solve. If the interviewer can see where youâ€™re going, they can course correct you. The worst thing you can do here is just start writing code-- they want to see how you think.


To practice white boarding interviews, here are a few sites we like: 
-  We like [Edabit](https://edabit.com/) to practice because they start out easy and get harder. You have a limited number of free problems-- go ahead and use all of them.
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) is also a great resource for practicing, although these problems start out harder.
