# Git Solo Flow

## First Things First

1. Make sure your code is saved in VS code. 
2. Make sure you are in the root of the directory where you see your index.html file.
3. Perform the following git commands: 
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
git status
```
- You will know this worked if you now see `(main)` next to your directory line in the terminal and the message says `nothing to commit, working tree clean`

## Next things next

4. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and make sure you are logged in.
5. In the upper right hand corner, you should see a bell, a + sign with a drop down arrow, and your avatar. Please click the + sign.
6. In the selections, click **New repository**
7. You will see a spot to name your repo, matching it to your local directory is helpful in remaining organzied. 
8. Make sure **Public** is selected as an option, and do not add a readme or a gitignore at this stage. The only thing that needs to be selected is **Public** on this page. 
9. Click **Create repository** at the bottom of the page.
10. You will be directed towards a quick set up page. Please copy the commands in the **â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line** block of code. 

## Last things last

12. Go back to your terminal.
13. On your keyboard, you will need to hit shift + insert which should be located close to your backspace
14. Go back to the GitHub repo you created, refresh the page and you should see the project you are working on.
