# Navigating ERD Relationships

In this chapter, you will write code that will iterate two arrays of data to find the information you need. When you click on a pet name, you want to display the name of the pet, and the name of the person who walks the pet.

Since those two bits of information are in different arrays, you will need to find the pet object, and then find the related walker object based on the foreign key.

Once you have this working, you will be using the same strategy in the next couple chapters.
