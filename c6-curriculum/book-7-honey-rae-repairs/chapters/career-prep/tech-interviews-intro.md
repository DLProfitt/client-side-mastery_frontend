# Tech Interviews 101 

At most companies, your interview process will go something like this: 
1. You'll apply by submitting your resume
1. Someone at the company, usually in HR, will contact you for a brief screen
1. You'll likely move on to a cultural interview, where you'll use the STAR examples you've been working on to talk about your experience

Some companies-- but not all-- have a fourth step: a technical interview. Some companies do the technical interview before the cultural interview. Most do it after. 

Just like the cultural interview is designed to gauge whether or not you'll be a good fit on the team, the technical interview is designed to gauge where you'll fit in terms of technical skills. 

Technical interviews can vary a lot from company to company, so it can be hard to know how to prepare. [Hereâ€™s a good rundown of the four main types of technical interview questions.](https://medium.com/@sax1johno/the-four-categories-of-technical-interview-question-and-how-to-ace-them-2c96678cdf79) 

Generally, the technical interview questions our grads have been ask fall into three buckets: 
1. Questions about your resume
1. Questions about technical concepts 
1. Whiteboard/ coding questions

We'll discuss how to talk about your resume in the second half of the program because at this point, you have stuff in the NewForce section on your resume that you haven't gotten to yet. For now, we'll focus on vocabulary from the front end of the course and what you can expect from a JavaScript coding interview.
