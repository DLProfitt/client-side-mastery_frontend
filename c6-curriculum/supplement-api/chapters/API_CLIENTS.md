# Popular Tools for APIs

These tools are listed in order from simplest UX to more advanced UX.

| # | Tool | Description |
|--|--|--|
| 1 | [Visual Studio Code: REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) | This is an extension to Visual Studio Code and uses text files, which you can integrate into your source code repository, to define the requests you want to test. Watch [Using the REST Client VSCode Plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcxvrhQKv8I) |
| 2 | [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) | Insomina has a clean, simple to use interface for managing a suite of API requests for a project. It does not have all the features of Postman _(see below)_ but is also easier to get started with. Watch the 26-minute [Insomnia REST Client Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H16GUC9Svyk) YouTube video to get started. |
| 3 | [Thunder Client for VS Code](https://www.thunderclient.com/) | Another Visual Studio code extension is ThunderClient. It has a bit more advanced functionality, but still fairly easy to learn and use. Watch [Thunder client - Vscode extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-YUD9qF-eQ) to learn the basics. |
| 4 | [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) | Postman is an extremely powerful API client, but is now also very hard to learn since it has dozens and dozens of features. The UX is quite complex, and will take more practice to learn how to use. There is a 2-hour [Postman Beginner's Course - API Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywxIQ2ZXw4) course on YouTube to get you started. Watching at 1.5x speed is recommended. |
