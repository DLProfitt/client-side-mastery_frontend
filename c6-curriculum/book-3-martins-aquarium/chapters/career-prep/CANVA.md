# Resume Design

By now, you should have drafted your resume text-- including your previous jobs, your personal profile, and your educational experience. Now it's time to make your resume look awesome! We recommend a program called Canva because it's easy to use and comes with great templates. 

>If you haven't had your one on one with Jordan yet, please pause here until you have. 

Canva is a drag-and-drop design site that makes resumes look professional. It takes a little getting used to, but we will have a crash-course in Canva and always be available to help. Here’s [Jen’s Canva Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gEqKarUx9is0_Yawc-qwTZWvrLrk3BHh/view?usp=sharing) as an example of what your resume will eventually look like. 

We’ve developed some design templates in Canva. Feel free to use these as a starting point and then edit colors, etc. to personalize. You are not required to use these templates if you want to use another format or further design but remember -- simple is better here so avoid over the top resume designs. 

Do not put your headshot on your resume. Why? When hiring, recruiters are trained to remain bias-free, and sending a resume with a picture of you compromises this. Some companies will throw out all resumes with photos to ensure a fair hiring process. A headshot will also detract from your listed experience. If they want to know more about you, they can visit your LinkedIn profile on your resume. If that weren’t enough, headshots aren’t ATS (Applicant Tracking System) friendly. More on the evil ATS later. 

## How to Put Together Your Resume in Canva

- Create a Canva account by visiting [Canva.com](http://canva.com) 
- Select a template that you like as a starting point:
    - [Template 1](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEUSMJyYTo/share/preview?token=g0qIuvb7OI6YGGZGPaSZgA&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEUSMJyYTo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)[ ](https://www.canva.com/design/DAERoEeyhQw/share/preview?token=5JRcyOLqkJAlcKfzsaCSAA&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAERoEeyhQw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) (two columns)
    - [Template 2](https://www.canva.com/design/DAESqk0ANTI/share/preview?token=6Db_Tr7tkAnBtA17SAZpLQ&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAESqk0ANTI&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) (one column)
   - [Template 3](https://www.canva.com/design/DAERuhfk2zU/share/preview?token=bAshcZ6o5RGWT39Z-AN4Mw&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAERuhfk2zU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) (two columns) 
   - [Template 4](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEVjv0Of_g/share/preview?token=ORR4aCbWHnhGAw9LDY1VgA&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEVjv0Of_g&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) (two columns) 
   - [Template 5](https://www.canva.com/design/DAESSTooHxA/share/preview?token=XV1UL1RD2GSUS-bGmZzBQg&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAESSTooHxA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) (two columns; best for a one-page resume) 
    - [Template 6](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEten5fs8M/share/preview?token=7AajeUQnHTBu0j7RiKSV-g&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEten5fs8M&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) (one column) 
   - [Template 7](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEteltW-8M/share/preview?token=MqZ2_p04xPgmsJnL3xUKLg&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEteltW-8M&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) (one column)

- You'll notice that these templates have a NewForce as the first bullet point, with some boilerplate resume text underneath. Use this as a placeholder for now. You'll customize your NewForce bullet points farther along in the course. 
- You'll also notice that these templates have space for your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. Go ahead and add your GitHub now. If you have a LinkedIn, go ahead and add it too-- if not, we'll get to LinkedIn in book 6!
- Make a copy of the template by going to FILE, selecting MAKE A COPY, and renaming it **Please do not edit one of the original templates.** 
- [Watch the vidoe tutorial on Canva!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UplTXcF5jamuDr3_dt7qD7CR9CL-N_kb/view?usp=sharing)
- Enter in the resume text from your Google Doc into the template. Ideally, we'd want your resume all on one page but two pages is also okay. (Any more than two is probably too much.) _You don't have to include every single bullet point from your Google Doc._ Your Google Doc is like a "bank" of all the possible stuff you'd ever want to put on a resume. You'll swap those bullet points in and out, depending on the job. 
- **When you're done, send an editable link to Jordan on slack so she can go over it!**
    - To share an editable link, click the top button that says "Share" and then click "Share Editable Link"
