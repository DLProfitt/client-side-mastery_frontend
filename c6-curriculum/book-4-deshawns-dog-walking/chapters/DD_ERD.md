# Entity Relationship Diagrams

In this chapter, you are going to use, discuss, and learn how to create your first Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). An ERD is a vital tool for software developers so that the data and the relationships between them can be visualized.

Let an instructor know when you reach this chapter and they'll make sure you get a live demo of relational data and ERDs. While you wait for your demo, you can go ahead to the next chapter.


## Practice

Once you have been introduced to the vocabulary and concepts of visualizing the resources in a database, work with your group to build an ERD for Deshawn's Dog Walking Service and then send it to an instructor to double check.
