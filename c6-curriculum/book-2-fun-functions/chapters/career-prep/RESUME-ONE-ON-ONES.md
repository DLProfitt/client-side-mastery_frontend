# Scheduling Your One-on-One

Congrats! By now, you've completed a rough draft of your resume. It's time to schedule a meeting with Jordan to go over your draft. She'll help you hype up your previous experience and connect it to tech, as well as help out with phrasing and Fancy Business Words. 

To schedule your one-on-one, send Jordan a DM on slack. Please include a link to your resume draft in the message. (To share your resume doc, click on the blue "Share" button and then click "Copy Link".)
